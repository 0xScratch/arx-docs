# Command Line Interface

See the [LibHaLo CLI example](https://github.com/arx-research/libhalo/blob/master/docs/desktop-cli.md) for more informaiton on interfacing with HaLos via a command line interface. You will need a USB reader like the [ARC122U](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=acr122u) in order to send messages to the HaLo.
