# Introduction

Arx Research is the manufacturing hub for [KONG Land](https://www.kong.land/) and it creates chips and protocols that trasform physical things into digital assets. Brands and creators can use these chips and protocols to create [eternal physical crypto assets](https://medium.com/kong-land-embassy/eternal-physical-crypto-b487ee8a1553) of any form -- fashion, collectables, art or virtually any item that a chip can be affixed to.

### How Arx Chips Work

At the heart of every Arx secure chip is a cryptographic identity that can be used to authenticate the chip on-chain permissionlessly. These include the [SiLo chip](../category/halo) and [HaLo chip](../category/halo) which use ECDSA signatures for authentication as well as to carry out on-chain actions. Both chips original from KONG 

There are a variety of ways that you can link digital assets -- like ERC-20 tokens and NFTs -- to chips leveraging custom function calls or escrow contracts which release assets upon signing. The [Physically Backed Token](https://www.pbt.io/) or PBT is [a novel non-fungible token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5791) that links physical assets immutably on-chain while ensuring that it can only be transferred through chip signatures. PBTs can still be viewed in existing wallets like standard [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFTs.

See [Highlighted Projects](../projects) for example projects.
