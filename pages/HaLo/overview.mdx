# Overview

Initially released in early 2022, HaLo chips ("Hardware Locked Smart Contracts") come in a variety of form factors and offer powerful secp256k1 signing capabilities.

HaLo chips self-generate their own secp256k1 ECDSA keypairs at the point of manufacture. This keypair is designed to be non-extractable for the life of the chip. Anyone with physical possession of a HaLo chip can instruct it to generate signatures which can be used on- and off-chain to authenticate it, transfer assets, whitelist addresses or more.

HaLo's signing capabilities are the same that you would find with a digital wallet like [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/) or [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). Signatures can be formatted to conform with different signing standards including [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) and [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) and can easily be verified via smart contract.
