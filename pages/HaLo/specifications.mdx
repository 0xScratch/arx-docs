## Tools

There are several open source libraries and apps that can be used to interface with HaLos:

- TODO: link to React app
- TODO: link to halo-cli
- TODO: link to library when ready

## Form Factors

TODO: add photos of different form factors

Available in several standard form factors including:

- Round, 27mm diameter tag
- Rectangular 30x50mmm tag
- Wrist bracelet tag
- CR80 card form factors

All form factors are machine washable and driable, however, note that foil or printed features will wear off over time due to abrasion. HaLo chips have an expected longevity of 10+ years depending on the frequency of use. HaLos can be adhered or embedded into most materials except for metal. See [Integration](../HaLo/integration) for more details and examples of embedding techniques.

Custom form factors and printing are available from Arx Research with certain minimum volumes.
