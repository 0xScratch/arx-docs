# Specifications

## Functionality

HaLo chips include ISO 7816 and ISO 14443 interfaces. See [Overview](../HaLo/overview) for more detail on these interfaces. 

HaLos generate and store secp256k1 keypairs that can be used to sign messages and transactions on- or off-chain. By design, HaLos do not expose any interface for the extraction, deletion or replacement of these keypairs.

## Form Factors

Available in several standard form factors including:

{/* - Round, 27mm diameter tag [insert photo of round chip]
- Rectangular 30x50mmm tag [insert photo of rectangle chip]
- Wrist bracelet tag [insert photo of wrist bracelet]
- CR80 card form factors [insert photo of CR80] */}

## Application Durability

All form factors are machine washable and driable, however, note that foil or printed features will wear off over time due to abrasion. HaLo chips have an expected longevity of 10+ years depending on the frequency of use.

The internal silicon for HaLos is rated for temperatures from -25° to 85°, however, the printed, foil and plastic elements of the HaLo may discolor, wear off, fade or warp at high temperatures within this range.

HaLos can be adhered to or embedded within most materials except for metal. See [Integration](../HaLo/integration) for more details and examples applications.

## Tools

There are several open source libraries and apps that can be used to interface with HaLos:
