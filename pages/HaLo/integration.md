# Integration

## Embedding

HaLo chips can be embedded in a variety of materials including plastic, fabric, epoxy, wood and glass. Typically we recommend that a HaLo be embedded no deeper than 1mm in another material, however, it's always critical to test embed several HaLos prior to mass production to ensure that readability is not compromised.

## Bulk Scanning

In order to enroll HaLos en masse, we have created a simple, open source browser-based scanning app that allows one to quickly capture chip information. 

This app is hosted at [bulk.vrfy.ch](https://bulk.vrfy.ch)
 and can capture chip information to the browser's local storage which is persistent across browser refreshes. Once all the desired chip information has been captured, it can be downloaded to the phone as a JSON-formatted file.

## Examples

For textiles and garments, creators have used a variety of means to embed HaLo chips including:

- Embroidered patches sewn or adhered above chips
- Silocone patches sewn around chips
- Under soft tags either at the neck, sleeve or torso of a garment
- Sewn into the corner of an existing pocket
- Stitched between two layers of a garment on a sleeve

Other notable integrations have included:

- Under a wood inlay
- Adhered to glass using a specialized epoxy
- Within a pressed vinyl record

## Metal

HaLo chips cannot typically be embedded on or under metal including foils and metallic threads in textiles. The only exception is that it is sometimes possible to attach HaLo chips to metallic items using an insulator such as thick double sided tape or a layer of epoxy.
