# Integration

## Embedding and Applications

HaLo chips can be embedded in a variety of materials including plastic, fabric, epoxy, wood and glass. 

Typically we recommend that a HaLo be embedded no deeper than 1mm in another material, however, it's always critical to test embed several HaLos prior to mass production to ensure that readability is not compromised.

<Callout type="warning">
HaLo chips cannot be embedded under or on metal. This includes foils and metallic threads in textiles. An insulator like thick double sided tape, plastic or epoxy can sometimes be used to affix a HaLo to metal.

## Bulk Scanning

In order to enroll a large number of HaLos at once, we have created a simple, [open source browser-based scanning app](https://github.com/kong-org/halo-bulk-web) that allows one to quickly capture chip information.

This app is hosted at [bulk.vrfy.ch](https://bulk.vrfy.ch)
 and can capture chip information to a browser's local storage which is persistent across page refreshes. Once all the desired chip information has been captured, it can be downloaded to the phone as a JSON-formatted file.

## Examples

For textiles and garments, creators have used a variety of means to embed HaLo chips including:

<MediaGrid medias={[
    {src: '/images/above.jpg', caption: 'Embroidered patches or soft tags sewn or adhered above chips'},
    {src: '/images/around.jpg', caption: 'Silocone patches sewn around chips'},
    {src: '/images/corner.jpg', caption: 'Sewn into the corner of an existing pocket'},
    {src: '/images/two-layers.jpg', caption: 'Stitched between two layers of a garment on a sleeve'}
]}/>

Other notable integrations have included:

- Under a wood inlay [insert graphic of mattaglass wood]
- Adhered to glass using a specialized epoxy [insert graphic of mattaglass bong]
- Within a pressed vinyl record [insert graphic of OCR record]
