# Integration

## Embedding and Applications

HaLo chips can be embedded in a variety of materials including plastic, fabric, epoxy, wood and glass. 

Typically we recommend that a HaLo be embedded no deeper than 1mm in another material, however, it's always critical to test embed several HaLos prior to mass production to ensure that readability is not compromised.

<Callout type="warning">
HaLo chips cannot be embedded under or on metal. This includes foils and metallic threads in textiles. An insulator like thick double sided tape, plastic or epoxy can sometimes be used to affix a HaLo to metal.

## Bulk Scanning

In order to enroll a large number of HaLos at once, we have created a simple, [open source browser-based scanning app](https://github.com/kong-org/halo-bulk-web) that allows one to quickly capture chip information.

This app is hosted at [bulk.vrfy.ch](https://bulk.vrfy.ch)
 and can capture chip information to a browser's local storage which is persistent across page refreshes. Once all the desired chip information has been captured, it can be downloaded to the phone as a JSON-formatted file.

## Examples

For textiles and garments, creators have used a variety of means to embed HaLo chips including:

- Embroidered patches sewn or adhered above chips [insert graphic of IRLart NASTY patch]
- Silocone patches sewn around chips [insert graphic of MF silicone patch]
- Under soft tags either at the neck, sleeve or torso of a garment [insert graphic of MF wicked sunday club shirt tag or genesis bomber]
- Sewn into the corner of an existing pocket [insert graphic of IRLart sewn corner]
- Stitched between two layers of a garment on a sleeve [insert graphic of Azuki x Ambush sleeve]

Other notable integrations have included:

- Under a wood inlay [insert graphic of mattaglass wood]
- Adhered to glass using a specialized epoxy [insert graphic of mattaglass bong]
- Within a pressed vinyl record [insert graphic of OCR record]
