# Command Mode

The user is able to execute a command -- such as sign a message using one of the available keys -- through the NDEF layer. 

## Example

1. Prepare NDEF message with one record (`{recordType: "unknown", data: challenge}`);
2. Write the message to the chip using standard writing method as described in NFC Forum Type 4 Tag specification. Depending on the platform and interface there may be explicit [NDEF write commands available](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NDEFReader/write) or you may need to construct the write using lower-level ADPU commands.
3. Perform NDEF read. The chip will return a single NDEF record containing the URL.
4. Parse URL’s `cmd` field and verify whether it contains the command input in step #1.
5. Parse URL’s `res` field to obtain the command execution result.
6. Verify ECDSA signature.

See the [halo-webnfc-demo](../NDEF/demo) for an example HaLo web app which signs a randomly generated challenge using key slot #1.
