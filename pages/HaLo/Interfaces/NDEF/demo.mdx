# WebNFC Demo

For WebNFC enabled browsers, you can access both read and write via NDEF to the chips without the need for a dedicated app. We have created [a demo React web app](https://github.com/kong-org/halo-webnfc-demo) which demonstrates reading, writing and verifying signatures. Refer to [Explicit Command Mode](../NDEF/command) and [Record Structure](../NDEF/params) for more information on how to construct commands and parse results.

_Note that WebNFC is only available in [a limited number of browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_NFC_API) today._
