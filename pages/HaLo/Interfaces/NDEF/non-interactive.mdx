# Non-Interactive Mode

`2023 Only` When no command was explicitly written by the user during the chip's last scan, it will automatically generate the default command which signs a unique challenge using key slot #2.

## Example

1. Scan the HaLo chip for NDEF contents.
2. Extract URL from NDEF record #1.
3. Parse public key structure inside the URL’s `static` param, see section 2.2.1.
4. Parse command contained in the URL’s `cmd` param, see 2.2.3.1. After this step, the user will obtain a 32 byte challenge value.
5. Parse response contained in the URL’s “res” param, see 2.2.3.2. After this step, the user will obtain a variable length DER encoded ECDSA signature.
6. Verify ECDSA signature using the following parameters:
    - Public key: second element in the array of tag’s public keys obtained from step #3;
    - Data: 32 byte value from step #4;
    - Signature: Value from step #5;
    - Signature encoding: DER;
    - Hashing: none (direct digest verification);
